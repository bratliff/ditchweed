\fs36 Although I didn\'92t see Roman that often, I forever respect his commitment to his family.  Roman struck me as dutiful and even-keeled, with an excellent outlook on life.  He was widely admired and loved. His love for his family was abundant and apparent.  He had an inspired outlook on life and was courageous in the face of death.  We should all hope to leave such an impression on this world as he did. He will be missed.}
